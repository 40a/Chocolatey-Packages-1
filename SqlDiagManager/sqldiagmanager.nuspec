How it works
This tool lets you customize what you want to collect and then let you create a data collection package. You extract the package and run SQLdiag data collector engine on the SQL Server you are troubleshooting.

2.Default templates: You can choose SQL Server version and platform (32 bit or 64 bit). The tool will automatically choose a default template for the combination. This will have default set of perfmon counters, profiler traces.
3.Shipped with ready to use Custom collectors:  Most commonly used custom collectors include SQL Server 2005, 2008 or 2008 R2 performance collector. 
4.Customization/Extensibility:  You can customize what perfmon and profiler trace events you want to collect.   Additionally, you can create your own custom collectors with TSQL Scripts, batch files and utilities.   See customization guide. 
5.Packaging:  With a single click of save, the tool will package all your files into a single cab so that you can ship to the machine where you intend to run on.
